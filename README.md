The goal was to make a lightweight featureless text editor that launches quickly, can 
read/write text files, and requires minimal resources.

I was looking for a program that I could use to quickly jot down notes, idealy just as 
quick as the ideas themselves. For a long time, TextEdit fit my needs. But with OS X 
Mountain Lion, Apple added many new features to TextEdit, none of which I needed or was
interested in. I then looked around the internet for a perfect replacement to the
now-bloated TextEdit. I found some good ones (Kod, GEdit, BBEdit), but none fit the needs
I was looking for. I was looking for the functionality of Stickies, with the ability to
save to .txt files for best portability. So I decided to make my own. Enjoy :)





Here is version 1.0
 - for now only supports UTF-8 Encoding
